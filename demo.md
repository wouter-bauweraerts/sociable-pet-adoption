# Demo outline

## What will we see during the demo?
The purpose of the demo is to show the power of **sociable testing**.
I will demonstrate the differences between both solitary and sociable unit testing,
where we will investigate some different aspects:
- Test setup
- Test complexity
- Test focus
- Test readability
- Test maintainability

Check the **[comparison](./comparison) page** for more details.
